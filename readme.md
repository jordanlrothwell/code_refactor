## üí¨ Description
For this project, I was tasked with <span style="color:orange">refactoring</span> the site's html and CSS to improve accessibility without changing its appearance. Some aspects (e.g. removing redundant classes/attributes) were relatively straightforward. Others, such as such as deciding on suitable 'alt' text for the page's images, proved to be more of an art than a science.

## ‚ôø Accessibility Improvements

<span style="color:orange">Title</span> and <span style="color:orange">meta</span> tags were added to the head, including a page description and viewport instructions (for smaller devices).

<span style="color:orange">HTML elements</span> were originally non-semantic (e.g. '\<div>'). Some non-semantic elements remain, however the majority have been altered to reflect the nature of their content.

<span style="color:orange">Alternative text </span>for images was originally descriptive (from top to bottom):
    
    "Exercise book surrounded by office supplies."
    "Worker holding phone and typing on laptop simultaneously."
    "Busy conference table with colourful social media icons."

    "Funnel with gear at top and money coming out bottom."
    "Suit jacket with light bulb in place of head."
    "Gear surrounded by coins."  

However, none of the images on the page add meaning to the content they accompany). Therefore, the author has decided to use blank alt attributes (i.e. '\<img alt = "">) after consulting accessibility best practice resources.

An <span style="color:orange">aria-label</span> was assigned to the emoji heart in the footer to convey its meaning to screen readers.

A <span style="color:orange">hidden description </span> was added before the navigation links to explain that they only redirected focus elsewhere on the same page (rather than externally). The description is visible to screen readers, but does not display visually.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Tests
The site's accessibility was periodically tested using the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool and Chrome's Lighthouse Web Developer Tool. Links to access these resources have been listed below.

## ‚åö Future Improvements
Accessibility could be improved for visually-impaired persons by increasing the <span style="color:orange">contrast</span> between the font and background colour for the sidebar and footer sections. 

The site's sluggish performance limits accessibility for users with slower internet connections or less powerful devices. Lighthouse suggests the <span style="color:orange">bulky images</span> are the main culprits, and could be improved in the following ways:
